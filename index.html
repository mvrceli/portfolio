            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My love for programming started in middle school, where I took my first Python classes. Then
                in high school I enrolled in even more computer science classes, and I knew that this is what I wanted
                to do for the rest of my life. <br><br> I chose to study Business Analytics, thinking a combination of Business
                and Computer Science would work, however I quickly found out that I want to be solely focused on
                programming, so I swapped to a bachelor in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous shopping agent</h2>
            <p>A Python bot that uses proxies, threading, and web scraping to quickly and efficiently purchase limited
                items off the internet. Worked on 3 different websites: Supreme, Stussy and Palace. There is a working
                GUI, where you can input the desired item, number of instances, max cost to limit an accidental
                purchase, and many more.</p>
